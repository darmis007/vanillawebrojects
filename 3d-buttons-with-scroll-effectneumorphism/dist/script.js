// The parallax is made with CSS perspective.
// 1. The parallax-container has a perspecive and controls the page scrolling
// 2. The parallax-children is only for passing down the perspective to it's children (the perspective only affects the child, not the chils children if you're not using `transform-style: preserve-3d`)
// 3. To pop something out from the page (or inwards), I transform the Z position.

// Cred to Keith Clarc for inventing the technique: https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/
